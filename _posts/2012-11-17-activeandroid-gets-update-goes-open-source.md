ActiveAndroid just has undergone quite a few changes and a major refactor. Speed is up, and support has been added for database attachment. ActiveAndroid’s commercial status has supported its growth in the past couple years, but I’ve decided to be truer to Android’s open source nature, and publish it on Github. I feel that the move to open source will only make ActiveAndroid better for everyone.

Thanks to everyone who has supported ActiveAndroid in the past, and go check out the source over at Github!
