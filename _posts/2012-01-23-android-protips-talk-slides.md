I recently gave a talk on Android at [CodeMash](http://codemash.org/) called Android Protips. I’ll be giving this talk a few more times this year. I’ll be at Code PaLOUsa on March 16th, and [AnDevCon III](http://www.andevcon.com/) on May 16th.

If you can’t make either of those dates, or you just want the slides, you can grab them here!
