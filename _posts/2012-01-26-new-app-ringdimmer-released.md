I’ve just released a new app for Android that adjusts the ringtone and notification volume based on ambient noise. The app is available on the Android Market for $0.99. Check it out on the [Android Market](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.michaelpardo.ringdimmer) or the [RingDimmer](http://www.ringdimmer.com/) homepage!
